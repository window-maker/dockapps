  * Another bugfix to IMAP msglst when headers are abnormal.
  * Avoid strcpy for overlapping regions.

  * Update security.debian.rb for ruby 1.8.
  * Bugfix to avoid infinite loop when reading from IMAP.
  * Bugfix to msglst to allow capitalized header names.

  * On Mac, ask the keychain for passwords if 
    askpass = internal:apple:keychain
  * Bugfix to an infinite loop found in the 
    TLS interface.
    
Release 0.4.16 - July 7, 2003
  * Checks TLS certificates.  See wmbiffrc(5) for 
    details on the certfile option.  Designed to work
    with mutt.
  * Show a busy mouse cursor while talking to remote
    servers, to show that wmbiff won't be responsive 
    to mouse clicks for a little bit.
  * New buttontwo (middle click) action to complement 
    action (left mouse click) and fetchcmd (right mouse).
  * #'s are now only comments in .wmbiffrc at the 
    beginning of lines or following whitespace, 
    allowing #'s in (most) passwords.
  * AppleScript examples for driving Apple's Mail 
    application in sample.wmbiffrc
  * Special mailbox action 'msglst' brings up a 
    transient window showing message headers from IMAP
    and program output for shell methods.  This is 
    intended to be faster than starting up a new 
    mail program or re-executing a script.
  * Avoid repetitive error messages when disconnected.
  * Use conventional -geometry option handling.
  * Fix bug in 0.4.15 to re-enable *'s in IMAP passwords.

Release 0.4.15 - Mar 30, 2003
  * Frobnicate internally stored passwords, partially 
    obfuscating them in memory.  Not actually more 
    secure, but harder to casually discover a password.
  * Tighten configuration file lines to more quickly
    detect misconfiguration.  Add the -relax option if
    it is too paranoid.
  * Add support for -bg to round out -hi and -fg color
    specifiers.

Release 0.4.14 - Jan 24, 2003
  * Handle building on systems with both posix and gnu
    regex in different but conflicting files.  
  * Restart wmbiff on SIGUSR1.  You may need to use 
    'killall -USR1 wmbiff' if it gets stuck.
  * Restart wmbiff on ctrl-shift mouse 1.

Release 0.4.13 - Jan 20, 2003
  * Fix a file descriptor leak when using 
    both Shell and IMAP clients.
  * Portability to Mac OS X, Solaris, and probably BSD
    restored (thanks sourceforge compile farm!) with a
    partial rewrite of regular expression handling for
    IMAP and POP mailboxes.

Release 0.4.12 - Jan 3, 2003
  * Fix a bug introduced in 0.4.9 that interfered with
    -geometry handling. (Debian #173813)

Release 0.4.11 - Dec 28, 2002
  * security.debian.rb script to check for updates on 
    security.debian.org, installed in $prefix/lib/wmbiff/
    add: path.x=/usr/lib/wmbiff/security.debian.rb to 
    your .wmbiffrc (and install ruby if you haven't already).
  * Internal cleanups to allow long askpass commands.

Release 0.4.10 - Dec 12, 2002
  * Peter McAlpine's globalnotify feature - elect to play a 
    sound on new mail in *any* mailbox without a chorus of
    sounds from every mailbox.
  * -skip-certificate-check option for when your imaps server
    is misconfigured and you can't do anything about it.

Release 0.4.9 - Dec 1, 2002
  * GNUTLS v0.5.9 or higher required
  * Check TLS certificate hostname against the hostname we're
    connecting to.  This raises the bar, but does not make 
    wmbiff's TLS implementation secure against man in the 
    middle attacks.
  * WMBiff scales to the number of mailboxes you're
    using. For openbox, this means less wasted space in the
    slit and the possibility of up to 40 mailboxes.  For
    WindowMaker, this means more pretty chrome and less dark
    LED if you have only a couple boxes.  If you prefer the empty
    cells at the end, place "path.4=<space><space>" in your 
    .wmbiffrc.
    
Release 0.4.8 - Sept 18, 2002
  * GNUTLS v0.5.1-0.5.6, gcrypt v1.1.8 required.
  * Allow spaces in IMAP mailbox paths.  The new syntax is:
    server/"mail box with spaces" where the old is server/mailbox.
    See wmbiffrc(5) for details.
  * Avoid filesystem caching for network mounted maildirs.
    See wmbiffrc(5) for details. (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)

Release 0.4.7 - August 16, 2002
  * GNUTLS v0.5.1, gcrypt v1.1.8 required. (no other changes)

Release 0.4.6 - July 19, 2002
  * Ignore sigpipe so that apm suspend works with IMAP/TLS.
  * Memory handling bugfixes to appease valgrind.
  * GNUTLS v0.4.3, gcrypt v1.17 expected

Release 0.4.4 - June 27, 2002
  * GNUTLS version 0.4.3 required.  The API has changed, and 
    wmbiff is no longer compatible with GNUTLS versions prior
    to 0.4.3.  Certificate checking may be slightly more strict.
  * GCRYPT version 1.1.7 is expected as well.
  * Partial rewrite of mailbox-parsing code, splint annotations.
  * Bugfix in debug messages of ShellClient.
  * Internal cleanups; migration to autoconf 2.5

Release 0.4.3 - June 8, 2002
  * IPv6 support for real. (missed a detail with autoconf)
  * Preliminary font support, allowing variable colors.  Use
    wmbiff -fg violet to give it a spin.  Note: if the number of
    old messages is at least 1000, the old number of messages
    will not be completely erased when new mail arrives.
  * Mouse handling fix.
  * Cleanup of internals: handling of default configuration when
    .wmbiffrc does not exist, vertical position of rows, variable 
    names, etc.
  * GNUTLS version 0.3.5 is expected; earlier and later versions
    may be incompatible.
  * This release is by Neil Spring <nspring@cs.washington.edu>.

Release 0.4.2 - June 1, 2002
  * Bugfix: accidentally released a partial feature.

Release 0.4.1 - June 1, 2002

  * This release is by Neil Spring <nspring@cs.washington.edu>.
  * GNUTLS version 0.3.5 is expected; earlier and later versions
    may be incompatible.
  * IPv6 is now supported, thanks to Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino

Release 0.4.0 - May 3, 2002

  * This release is by Neil Spring <nspring@cs.washington.edu>.
  * GNUTLS version 0.3.5 is expected; earlier and later versions
    may be incompatible.
  * askpass: Passwords can be left empty for IMAP: ssh-askpass
    will be used to prompt the user.  See sample.wmbiffrc 
    and wmbiffrc(5).
  * skinfile: Background pixmaps can be specified in .wmbiffrc.
    This has the effect of "skins."  See wmbiffrc(5).
    Add "skinfile=wmbiff-master-contrast.xpm" to .wmbiffrc 
    for a more readable wmbiff.
  * finger: Finger client added - finger a user's mailbox to get its
    status.  Requires perl and finger commands. See wmbiffrc(5).
    Thanks to Andelko Horvat.
  * shell: Improvements to ShellClient - now allows three character 
    text to be printed as status.  If "new" is on the output
    line, the text will be in yellow. Thanks to Andelko Horvat.
  * mbox: Paths can be specified including shell expressions 
    in `'s.  If requested, this feature can be expanded to other 
    clients.  Nested expressions are not supported.
  * Permissions on .wmbiffrc are checked to protect security.
    Only a warning is printed now.  This will degenerate in 
    later releases for .wmbiffrc's that store passwords.
  * Migrated to automake / autoconf to detect defaults for
    ssh-askpass and prepare for future changes.
  * Bugfix to handle -geometry tags with dimension as generated
    by fvwmSaveDesk. The size is ignored. (in Debian 0.3.8-3)

Release 0.3.8 - Tue, 26 Mar 2002 17:17:07 +0100

  * Added GnomeICU support.
  * Added an experimental shell command method which reads the output
    for a given command. See wmbiffrc(5) for details.
  * Debug support moved to runtime, using the -debug switch.
  * Fix for the install rule in Makefile.

Release 0.3.7 - Sun,  3 Feb 2002 23:46:44 +0100

  * No, 0.3.6 never happened :)
  * Removed unneeded auth list fix which broke things.
  * Makefile cleanup, with better FreeBSD support. You can now easily
    use the external GNU regex lib.

Release 0.3.6 - Sun, 27 Jan 2002 20:49:52 +0100

  * Added a new syntax for IMAP, which allows using a "@" in
    the password field. See wmbiffrc(5) for details.
  * Fix for a correct usage of the auth list in IMAP.

Release 0.3.5 - Mon, 14 Jan 2002 02:43:23 +0100

  * Added support for GNUtls 0.3. You can still compile wmbiff using
    GNUtls 0.2.x by removing the GNUTLS_VER=3 define in the Makefile.
  * Fixed password quoting in IMAP logins.

Release 0.3.4 - Fri, 23 Nov 2001 16:56:29 +0100

  * "imaps" is now prefered to "sslimap" in config files. The old type
    is still supported for backwards compatibility.
  * You can now specify what protocol wmbiff should use for a given Pop3
    or IMAP mailbox. If unspecified, it will try the secure ones first,
    falling back to unsecure if they fail. See wmbiffrc(5).
  * Added some debug messages for tls connections.
  * Pop3 path parsing rewrite.
  * Manual page fixes.
  * Compile warning fixes.

Release 0.3.3 - Mon, 29 Oct 2001 14:55:00 +0100

  * Sanity check to IMAP code: exit if wmbiff tries to connect to more
    than 5 servers.
  * Fix a missbehaviour of cram-md5 (broke pop3).
  * Documentation updates.

Release 0.3.2 - Tue, 23 Oct 2001 20:30:37 +0200

  * After some tries (other OpenSSL based patches, independent APOP
    & CRAM-Md5 patches) we've come up with something based on GNUtls and
    gcrypt, which are GPL based and have no licensing issues for us.
    See ChangeLog for details.
  * WMBiff now supports IMAP-SSL, APOP and CRAM-Md5 authentication. These
    can be disabled at compile time, commenting out the WITH_TLS and
    WITH_GCRYPT defines. (Neil Spring, NAKAYAMA Takao and Jay T. Francis).

Release 0.3.1 - Sun, 24 Jun 2001 20:15:41 +0200

  * Replaced /var/spool/mail with /var/mail, which is what the FHS mandates.
    All decent systems should have either the directory or a symlink pointing
    somewhere else. (Jordi Mallach)
  * I reformatted ths changelog, again.  I hope this is the last time I need
    to do this.  The CVS logs should be used for all changes, and this file
    should by updated for user-visible changes only, from now on.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Updated the README to reflect that Gennady Belyakov died right after
    releasing wmBiff 0.2.  May your soul rest in peace, Gennady.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Fixed the IMAP support, again. (Rob Funk)


Release 0.3.0 - Fri, 16 May 2001 12:16:44 +0200

  * [ReadLine] removed previous trim leading spaces, added TrimFull.  Fixes
    Debian Bug #95849 (Mark Hurley).
  * There was a bug where if a POP3 or IMAP mailbox read failed and the
    following reads were successful, but no mail was in the server, the given
    mailbox would remain reading "XX". Now it updates the counter no matter
    what the read was (Mark Hurley).
  * wmBiff would only count as new mails in mbox mailboxes with "N" flags,
    ignoring those marked "ON" (Rob Funk).
  * Fixed reading of quoted imap folders, which some IMAPd's do (Rob Funk).
  * README: updated some very obsolete info. (Jordi Mallach)


Release 0.2q1+Debian - Tue,  1 May 2001 10:11:00 +0000

  * Moved to CVS at SourceForge. (Jordi Mallach)


Release 0.2q1 - Fri, 13 Apr 2001 02:47:10 -0400

  * This release is by Mark Hurley <debian4tux@telocity.com>.
  * wmbiff/Client.h: move DEBUG_* macros to wmbiff/Makefile
  * wmbiff/Pop3Client.c:
    + My password contains an  @  character.  This causes
      the pop3 line to be incorrectly parsed by wmbiff.
      * Drop all of the ":" after the pop3 and delimit all values with
        spaces.  This works well, as passwords/user-id's all agree that
        the space is a non-legit value.
         
        Example: assume my password is:  myEmailhasa@init
         
        Old way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux:myEmailhasa@init@mail.telocity.com

        New way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux myEmailhasa@init mail.telcoity.com
        
        Ahh...before you say it.  "Backward compatibility?" You will
        also find in the patch, a NEW function.  So that the OLD and
        NEW way is easily compatible with all ".wmbiffrc" files.
        
        Dev. Comments:
        This was not the cleanest way to implement it, but I had to
        suffice with a clean/quick implementation.  I originally wrote
        one function to handle past and new parsing.  However, I
        thought it would be beneficial to leave them separated, so we
        could eventually drop the old method?
        
        Related Changes:
        The man page will need to be updated (not provided in patch).
        We can weed the "old" style out of the example script as well.
        Still explaining the changes in the man page to leave out
        confusion in a users mind (as they are likely to find "old"
        style scripts).
    + My mail server at Telocity.com is following the RFC's to
      a "T".  RFC 1725 states that the LAST command be removed.
      After some searching I have NOT turned up a replacement.
      Which does make sense, this command is only so useful,
      and contributes to the popularity of other such remoting
      such as LDAP?
      * I've set the Unread messages to the TotalMessages,
        assuming (as suggested by the RFC) no messages have been
        read.  I have also suppressed the error printed to
        stderr, it is correct to return an error, *now*.  ;)

        The only way to keep track of messages which have been
        read, is to remember the unique number assigned to them.
        This is what fetchmail does.  However, it does not work
        correctly if you check and read mail thru other methods
        (a web mail client).
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c:
        -       for (index = 0; index < 4; index++)
        +       for (index = 0; index < 5; index++)
    
        BUG!  Last postion #4 was not correctly being checked.
        Now correctly checks each position.


Release 0.2q - Tue, 20 Mar 2001 05:32:35 +0100

  * This release is by Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es>.
  * wmbiff/{*.[ch]}: removed unnecesary includes.
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c: some cleanups and optimizations. 
    + init_biff:
      * show error if user config file does not exists
      * use of userconfig "interval" (wasn't correctly parsed)
    + {do_biff, displayMsgCounters}: some changes to make Sleep_Interval
      and Blink_Mode local
    + parse_cmd: some changes to make uconfig_file local
    + {BlinkOn, BlinkOff, BlinkToogle}: Removed (merged by do_biff)
    + {ReadConfigString, ReadConfigInt}: Removed 
    + countmail: removed init in header (wasn't used)
    + ReadLine: Created (new parsing code, extracts pairs of setting
      and value)
    + Read_Config_File: now there is only ONE parse not 36!
  * wmbiff/{IMap4Client.c, Pop3Client.c}: check for correct format line to 
    avoid "segmentation fault" while parsing.


Release 0.2p - Mon, 12 Mar 2001 00:00:00 -0600

  * This release is by Dwayne C. Litzenberger <dlitz@dlitz.net>.
  * Added maildir support!  Yay!
  * Stole the manpages from Debian.
  * Massive (lack of) coding style cleanup; Standardized coding style using
    GNU indent.
  * Reversed order of ChangeLog as suggested by Jordi.
  * Cleaned up the v0.2o ChangeLog entry.  What a mess!  Added missing credits.
  * Cleaned up and reformatted the rest of the changelog to an almost-Debian
    format while I'm at it.  It's much more readable that way.
  * Moved definition of WMBIFF_VERSION to the Makefile.
  * All your base are belong to us.
  * I'm not maintaining wmBiff; I just submitted a big patch.  Send your
    complaints (or complements) to Yong-iL Joh.
  

Release 0.2o - Mon, 12 Mar 2001 00:00:00 +0900

  * This release is by Yong-iL Joh <tolkien@mizi.com>.
  * I don't think the date of this changelog entry is right.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>, Debian's wmbiff maintainer, sent
    me an email a couple of days ago which included a patch with man pages.
    The patch did the following:
      + Fixed a major upstream bug that renders this new wmbiff unusable.
        Thanks to Guillaume Morin, Jérôme Marant and Mark Hurley for their
        help identifying the bug, and Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> for
        writing a patch. Basically, the new upstream broke backwards
        compatibility of wmbiffrc with Gennady's wmbiff, fixed that.
        This patch also fixes wmbiff not using $MAIL or defaulting to
        /var/spool/mail/$USER if no ~/.wmbiffrc is found (closes: #87778).
      + wmbiff/wmbiff.c: updated WMBIFF_VERSION to current.
      + wmbiff/{socket.c, wmbiff.c}: removed <sys/time.h> includes.
      + debian/{wmbiff.1, wmbiffrc.5}: updated for IMAP4 and Licq support.
      + Jorge García removed the segfault in Jordi's wmbiffrc
      + Vladimir Popov <pva48@mail.ru> fixed a potential buffer overflow
        in init_biff() (The "/* Make labels look right */" section).
      + Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> fixed a display bug in the
        number-of- mails display.
  * use poll() instead of select()
