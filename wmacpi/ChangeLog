2008 March 18 2.2rc3
	Some fixes for the sysfs interface support, supplied by
	jblache@debian.org:

	> Okay, I finally found time to make a new release including this
	> patch - 2.2rc2. It's up on my website now.

	I don't remember sending you the updated patch, as it turned out that
	you can have different attributes in sysfs depending on what the
	battery reports.

	The current version is attached.

	Thanks,

	JB.

	
2008 March 14 2.2rc2
	Support for the sysfs interface that became mandatory with kernel
	2.6.24 (patch supplied by jblache@debian.org).

	A number of graphics fixes also from jblache@debian.org.

	Removed support for hardware reported critical battery status.
	
2007 July 14 2.2rc1
	Major changes to command line handling and to the way we use
	libdockapp, courtesy of Patrice Dumas. This should hopefully fix
	several long-standing bugs with non-wmaker window managers (in
	particular Debian bugs #280495 and 293546).

	Updated to support newer kernels that no longer support
	/proc/acpi/info - thanks to Samuel Ortiz.

	Fixed a longstanding issue with redrawing - thanks to Vito
	Caputo. 

	This version changes a number of command line options (little used
	ones, but they're still incompatible changes) due to the
	libdockapp work. In particular, -w becomes -x, -v becomes -V (and
	takes an argument rather than being repeated), and -V becomes -v
	(thanks to libdockapp grabbing -h, -v and -w for itself). Also,
	long options are now supported for everything in wmacpi (but not
	acpi, since it doesn't use libdockapp for command line parsing).
	
2007 January 10 2.2a1
	Added a patch from Patrice Dumas to support newer versions of
	libdockapp.

	Updated email address in AUTHORS and manpages.

2005 February 2 2.1
	Finalised libdockapp-0.5.0 port - no changes from 2.1rc1.
	
2005 Jan 5 2.1rc1
	Typo fix in the manpage.

	Ported to libdockapp-0.5.0 - all this needed was changing the
	type of the dockapp width and height to unsigned short.
	
2004 October 24 2.0
	Upped version number to 2.0.

	Small typo fixes.

	wmacpi 2.0 goes gold . . .
	
2004 September 28 2.0rc1
	Added support for switching to capacity mode automatically, on
	detecting dodgy reports from the battery.

	Added support for capacity mode on charging, with automatic
	enabling as per discharging.

	Various cleanups.

	Hopefully last release before the final 2.0.
	
2004 August 18 1.99r7
	Implemented the libdockapp port - this seems to close Debian bug
	#227819, but it hasn't received sufficient testing.

	Implemented a capacity mode for calculating time remaining (as
	opposed to the normal current rate mode) - this mode samples the
	remaining capacity of the battery and notes the time at which it
	was sampled, and uses a history of samples to estimate the rate of
	drain on the battery. From there it calculates a value for time
	remaining. 

	Also, various cleanups have gone in: 

	* a reworking of the scrolling code
	
	* generic battery number support (rather than just
	using two pixmaps, one for b1 and one for b2)

	* stopped the battery glyph from blinking when running on AC
	
2004 July 19 1.99r6
	Fix for Debian bug #250792 - the parser for the acpi files was
	too stupid to deal with error conditions. I've now added some
	basic checking to make it handle the error that caused the bug
	report, but I'll need to add more later.

2004 April 23 1.99r5
	Collected fixes for the collected fixes below . . .

	* Manpage fixes, to reflect the reality of the current code.

	* Code cleanups, to make a few things more sensible. Most notably,
	the interface for setting the samplerate has changed so that it's
	no longer inverted and illogical - you now say how many times you
	want to sample per minute.

	* Fixed an issue with initialisation - I'd moved the power_init()
	call below the options parsing code, without dealing with the -m
	option properly. The end result was that if you told it to monitor
	a battery number, it would fail saying the battery didn't exist. I
	moved the check for this out of the options parsing and after the
	power_init() call.

	* Fixed a leaking file descriptor in init_ac_adapters.

	* Implemented a way to handle changing batteries - reinitialise
	the battery info periodically. I don't know of a better way to do
	that, since we'd have to do all that parsing anyway to find out if
	it had changed . . .

	libdockapp is waiting, but I think that's the only change left
	without more bug repots . . .
	
2004 April 15 1.99r4
	Collected fixes for various small issues.

	* Fixed a problem with placement of the window when using the
	click to place mode - turned out to be a sizehints problem.

	* Some fixes to the manpage.

	* Reenabled the CLI build by default - the Debian patches can
	handle disabling it themselves.

	* Added a way to disable the scrolling message, since some users
	find this annoying.

	I've left the big changes that are needed (like using libdockapp,
	in the hope that it'll solve the docking problems) until later, so
	that I can get these smaller fixes out. Hopefully soon . . .
	
2004 January 12 1.99r3
	. . . and a fix for a fix that didn't fix it . . .
	
2004 January 12 1.99r2
	Some cleanups and bugfixes found by the wonderful Debian users.

	It's finally in testing!
	
2003 November 23 1.99
	Finally claimed the wmacpi name as my own . . . 

	Renamed wmacpi-ng and acpi-ng, renamed the header files, fixed up
	the makefile.

	For the Debian package, also made compilation of the command line
	tool optional, defaulting to not building it. This is because
	after the renaming, my acpi clashes with the acpi package that's
	already in Debian. The command line functionality is now
	accessible via the -w option to wmacpi.

	This is wmacpi 1.99, so that I can have a release packaged and in
	Debian before going to 2.0, so that any bugs that are left can be
	found by all the extra users.
	
2003 September 26 0.99
	Fix the last of the old wmacpi code oddities (specifically, the
	APMInfo struct, which was a completely inappropriate name given we
	no longer deal with APM, and because of the various code
	refactoring).

	I think this is probably as good as I can make it without getting
	more feedback and the like, so I'm going to make this version
	0.99, preliminary to either wmacpi-ng 1.0 or wmacpi 2.0 (depending
	which direction I go with that).
	
2003 September 23 0.92
	Fix a few more bugs, and include an option to allow the user to
	specify how often to sample the ACPI data - some BIOSes disable
	all interrupts while reading from the battery, which apparently
	causes some interactivity issues. I have no idea why reading once
	every three seconds (which is our default), but there've been some
	complaints. 

	Also fixed acpi-ng to properly handle the -a option.
	
2003 August 6 0.91
	Fix a problem I'm seeing with docking the app - if the window name
	is set to "acpi" rather than "apm" it doesn't dock . . .
	
2003 July 16 0.90
	Make the time display show '--:--' instead of '00:00' when the
	time remaining is 0 - I think this is reasonable, since it'll only
	get into this state when the present rate value is 0. This only
	happens when the battery is fully charged and neither discharging
	or charging, or when the battery is completely drained. In any of
	these states the time remaining is of very little interest, so we
	don't lose anything. We also get to handle the (sadly, very
	common) case where the ACPI subsystem doesn't report sane values
	for the things we depend on.
	
2003 July 11 0.50a2
	Make the time display show nothing (as opposed to 00:00) when the
	time remaining is unknown, as requested by Emma Jane Hogbin.

	Respect the critical level specified on the command line, and add
	a new message to differentiate between the command line critical
	level and the critical state reported by the battery.

	Speed up the message scrolling, so that there isn't quite such a
	painful delay between repeats. Also, up the speed when the battery
	is low, more when it's critical, and scroll continuously when it's
	hardware critical.

	Finally, add support for disabling the blinking power and battery
	glyphs from the command line, as requested by Sebastian
	Henschel. We still blink the battery glyph when the battery
	reports hardware critical level - I think that's worth being a bit
	annoying about.

	Also, added an acpi-ng manpage.
	
2003 July 11 0.50a1
	Properly fix the AC adapter issue - it's not much use adding the
	infrastructure and then forgetting to fix the code that uses it.

	Fix the time disiplay so that it doesn't try to display values
	greater than 99:59, since the display area won't fit anything
	beyond that.
	
2003 July 10 0.50a
	Bugfixes, to handle two problems: the case where something like
	the present rate or some such is "unknown" (reported initially by
	Emma Jane Hogbin, and where the AC adapter is called something
	other than "AC" (reported by Sebastian Henschel). This an 'a'
	release because I can't test these myself . . . 
	
2003 July 6 0.50
	Finally got rid of that annoying button - that space now contains
	a 'B 1' or 'B 2' (only those two at present, since I'm too lazy to
	fix it so that the number is generic. It should work fine for
	anyone who doesn't have a freakish system with more than two
	batteries . . .)

	A few more code cleanups.
	
2003 July 1 0.19
	libacpi cleanups and reworking - we now handle the charging
	battery case properly, it seems. 

	Also, some attempts to make error printing a bit cleaner; still a
	long way to go on that, though . . .
	
2003 June 24 0.15
	Removed process_plugin_timer(), since it was doing nothing useful
	at all . . .
	
2003 June 23 0.14
	Removed libapm.c - wmacpi-ng is specifically for ACPI, with no APM
	support. 
	
2003 June 23 0.13
	Some more code cleanups, designed to move libacpi to more of a
	library than something built into wmacpi-ng. This is useful with
	the seperate programs, though at present it's not used much.
	
2003 June 21 0.12
	Added a command line tool, acpi-ng to query battery status from
	the command line.
	
2003 May 30 0.11
	Implemented multiple battery support, and averaging of the samples
	in an attempt to even out the jumpiness of the timer.
	
2003 May 30 0.10
	More major code cleanups: in particular the handling of the power
	panel and the message has been cleaned up so that it's actually
	sane and clean. 

	Next step from here is to actually implement handling of multiple
	batteries, so that if there's a fully charge second battery
	available it reports the correct time remaining (based on the
	present rate of power consumption and the sum of the two battery's
	remaining capacities).
	
2003 May 29 0.3
	Some major reworking of the internals, to help fix the handling of
	multiple batteries and such things. 
	
2003 May 26 0.2a
	Code cleanups to fix various problems with corner cases.
	
2003 May 26 0.2
	Added support for multiple batteries: I took the simple route of
	displaying only one battery per instance - to do more I'd need to
	hack with the display code, and I'm not ready for that yet.
	
	Added a -m option to specify the battery number to monitor.
	
2003 May 26 0.1
	Changed package completely, to support the new ACPI code as of
	2.4.21-rc2. 

	Since this code hasn't been touched in more than a year, I figure
	I might as well have a go at hacking on it . . .

2002 Feb 17 1.34
    Updated ACPI statistics gathering code for the latest ACPI patch from
    Intel. Now uses/checks for subsystem version 20020214+. Redone the version
    check a little bit.

2001 Apr 29 1.33
    Little fix to ACPI version check so that I don't have to make a new
    version each time a new kernel comes out

2001 Mar 24 1.32
    Split ACPI and APM portions in different source files
    Added power_init() function - handles checking subsystem presence,
    version, etc.  Enumerates batteries in ACPI implementation
    ACPI: Beginnings of multiple battery support - not fully implemented
    ACPI: Get the battery ID from /proc/acpi/battery instead of hard-coding
          it in - also helps with multi battery stuff
    Added some stupid command line help
    Added -c option to set critical battery alarm level.  Defaults to
    10 percent, and added -b option to make noise when this critical level
    is reached
    APM: Updated for critical alarm stuff
    Made a 20 color "low" quality pixmap for machines running 8bit displays
    Updated README with some stuff, made separate INSTALL file

2001 Mar 13 1.31
    Update for intel ACPI release version 20010313
    Minor updates for new /proc layout

2001 Mar 07 1.3
    Update for intel ACPI release verion 20010302
    Proc format changed a little bit, so updates were necessary.
    Added a check for specific acpi subsystem version - since each
    new version seems to have a new interface, better be safe than
    sorry :)
    As usual, please test and report to me.

    This ONLY works with linux acpica 20010302.  Download this version from
    http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads.htm - it's a
    patch against 2.4.2

2001 Feb 28 1.21
    Finally read through the ACPI specification.  Hah, they had all my
    questions answered :)  Thus,

    Confirmed remaining percentage formula (correct)

    Now calculate "time remaining" according to the spec formula

    Removed "battery load" hack since we now have "time remaining"

    Fixed bug in display_percentage (10% didn't display right)

    Released version 1.21

2001 Feb 23 1.2
    Added support for ACPI.  This is very untested, and not very clean.
    This has been tested on machines with only ONE battery, and only
    with kernel 2.4.2 (that's where ACPI started to work for me)

    Added some hackery to do with ACPI.  Check README.

    Released 1.2

2001 Jan 16 1.1
    Fixed all the stuff so that wmapm works as advertised:
    	Fixed dumb bug where after charging was done new message didn't scroll.

    	Added support for fucked APM bioses that display stuff wrong. (See
	README to learn how to enable it. Obviously, it's disabled by default)
	
    	Reorganized apminfo structure and got rid of redundancy.
	
    	Reorganized acquire_apm_info.  All APM data is processed there.
	
    	Fixed display_state to do the Right Thing.
	
    	Fixed red blinking button to actually blink on critical battery, and
    	to stop when it isn't critical anymore.  I don't think it ever worked
	right in 1.0.

    Created ChangeLog.

    Updated README.

    Released 1.1.
