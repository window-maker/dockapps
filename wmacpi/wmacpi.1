.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B wmacpi
command.
.PP
.B wmacpi
is a program that displays the current battery status in a WindowMaker
dock app, on systems that support Intel's Advanced Configuration and
Power Interface specification (ACPI).
.PP
The program monitors a battery, displaying its current percentage
charge via a bar and a numeric value. It also displays the current
power status for the system, the time remaining (calculated based on
the remaining battery capacity and the current rate of power usage),
and a scrolling message with some hopefully useful information.
.PP
Clicking on the window cycles through the batteries that the ACPI
system knows about.
.PP
.B wmacpi-cli
queries the battery status from the command line. It prints the power
status, the percentage remaining for each battery found, and the time
remaining if the system is on battery, or the time remaining for each
battery to reach full charge if the batteries are charging.
.SH OPTIONS
.B wmacpi
.TP
.B \-c, --critical=percentage
Set critical low alarm at <percentage>% (default: 10%).
.TP
.B \-d, --display=display
Set the X display to open the window on.
.TP
.B \-m, --battery=battery number
Set the battery to monitor initially.
.TP
.B \-s, --sample-rate=sample rate
Set the rate at which to sample the ACPI data, in number of times per
minute. Minimum is 1, ie once a minute, default is 20, maximum is 600.
.TP
.B \-n, --no-blink
Disable blinking power glyph when charging. Note that it still blinks when 
the battery reports its capacity state as critical.
.TP
.B \-f, --force-capacity-mode
Force the use of capacity mode for calculating time remaining. By defalt
.B wmacpi
will use the reported values of remaining capacity and present rate to
calculate the time remaining on battery. This flag will force the use
of the remaining capacity and time samples to calculate the present
rate of drain, and from there the time remaining. Note that this mode
of calculation generally underreports the time remaining. This mode
works around certain buggy ACPI BIOSes that fail to report the current
rate.
.TP
.B \-x, --cmdline
Run wmacpi in command line mode - this operates identically to 
.B wmacpi-cli\&.
.TP
.B \-a, --samples=samples
Average the time remaining over num samples. This greatly improves the
accuracy of the reported time remaining.
.TP
.B \-V, --verbosity=num
Increase the verbosity of the program. Setting this to 1 will print extra 
error information; 2 will produce informational output; 3 will produce 
copious debugging output.
.TP
.B \-v, --version
Print the version information.
.TP
.B \-r, --no-scroll
Disable scrolling message.
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Display help.
.TP
.B wmacpi-cli
.TP
.B \-a num
Average the time remaining over num samples. This greatly improves the
accuracy of the reported time remaining.
.TP
.B \-V
Increase the verbosity of the program. If repeated, the result is the
same as setting 
.B \--verbosity
for
.B wmacpi
to the number of repetitions.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version information.
.TP
.B \-h
Display help.
