wmbattery (2.44) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Better AC detection.
  * Support times with upower and acpi (Closes: #740885).
  * Use the latest upower API (Closes: #748935).
  * Fix upower detection.

wmbattery (2.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Orphaned the package. It will probably be removed as it does not work with
    current kernels.
  * Added -i to display as icon. Thanks, Tovar Closes: #732398

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 27 May 2014 16:01:34 -0400

wmbattery (2.42) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Stop building with flash-in-the-pan HAL. Instead update acpi
    interface to use /sys/class/power_supply.
    Note that this needs acpica_version 20011018.
    Closes: #613166
    (Patch developed by Andrew Shadura.)
  * Also added support for upower, which is used by default,
    to avoid chasing kernel sysfs changes.
    (Patch developed by Andrew Shadura.)
    Closes: #727102

wmbattery (2.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add -s option which can be used to ignore fluctuations
    in reported battery charge (as seen on the EeePC) when
    using -e. Closes: #527870 (Joseph Huang)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 09 May 2009 16:53:10 -0400

wmbattery (2.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debhelper v7; rules file minimisation.
  * Depend on hal since /proc/acpi is gone from the default kernels now.
    Closes: #491099

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jul 2008 00:23:47 -0400

wmbattery (2.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Magic header file reordering to work around the disgusting
    linux-libc-dev/libc headers conflicts (#435700). Closes: #463811

wmbattery (2.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support reconnecting to dbus if it's restarted. (AKA giant dbus-PITA)

wmbattery (2.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support reconnecting to hal if the connection is closed, as happens
    if the hal is restarted.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Feb 2008 22:29:00 -0500

wmbattery (2.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't spew error messages if optional hal properties are not available.
  * Only check to see if a battery is charging if hal reports there is AC
    power. This is perhaps not 100% correct in systems with multiple batteries
    that may cross-charge when off AC, but it's faster and it avoids bugs in
    hal (#463740).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 02 Feb 2008 17:28:37 -0500

wmbattery (2.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bit the bullet, stopped trying to track the kernel's ever changing
    interfaces, and added support for querying battery information from hal.
    Support for the old kernel interfaces (APM, ACPI, etc) is still present,
    but to use new interfaces such 2.6.24's /sys/class/power_adapter, you'll
    have to have dbus and hal.
    Closes: #456247, #246641, #290712, #393616, #456248
  * Fix -e option.

wmbattery (2.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct issue with the statically allocated string returned by
    get_acpi_value that caused it to only look at last full capacity and never
    really at design capacity.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Dec 2007 22:26:38 -0500

wmbattery (2.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Guard some divisions against division by zero. I've never seen that
    happen and can't reproduce it, but see #454766.
  * Merge acpi change from procmeter3: Limit string length when reading from
    /proc/.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 07 Dec 2007 14:56:41 -0500

wmbattery (2.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Further fix for my strange battery. If the present capacity is larger
    than the maximum capacity, rescan to figure out the new max capacity.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 02 Dec 2007 15:50:29 -0500

wmbattery (2.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * My new battery has a design capacity of 7800 mAh and yet its
    last full capacity was 9488, and its currently charged to 8540.
    Deal with this wonderful miracle^W^Wcrap hardware by taking the max
    of the design or last full capacities.

wmbattery (2.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor bug fix to acpi code, don't skip over dotfiles.
  * Patch from Vincent Bernat adding support for 2.6.21, which changes
    yet again where the ACPI version number is stored. Closes: #423612

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 14 May 2007 14:23:09 -0400

wmbattery (2.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix acpi detection, the code to read /proc/acpi/info was not updated
    to the new cd-less code. Closes: #307278

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  2 May 2005 18:14:01 -0400

wmbattery (2.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge in changes from procmeter3's version of acpi.c, made by Andrew M.
    Bishop, that avoid the ugly chdir to /proc/acpi and add a bit of error
    checking. Now fully synced with procmeter3 3.4d.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Apr 2005 22:58:44 -0400

wmbattery (2.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Kris Verbeeck to add a -a option to play an au file
    on low battery.

wmbattery (2.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the proper new-style acpi string when looking for ac adaptor status.
    Closes: #220039
  * Remove the hack I added for my old picturebook, as it causes bad results
    on systems that label a fully charged battery's charging rate as
    unknown and state as charging.
  * Base battery charge calculations for ACPI on design capacity, instead of
    last full capacity. Some batteries may exceed previous last full on 
    their next charging, and this also lets you see when you have a damaged
    battery that is not fully charging.
  * If acpi battery charging state is unknown, but the rate is 0,
    then the battery is charged and on AC power, and the unknown state can
    be ignored. Analysis and patch by "TeXitoi".

wmbattery (2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make acpi code put -1 in the time remaining field if the "present rate"
    is 0. Closes: #204722
  * Enable internal time estimate code in this case.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Aug 2003 17:21:17 -0400

wmbattery (2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another patch from Hugo Haas, this time it adds time-till-charged
    estimates for systems that lack them. The estimates are on by default,
    though they're only linear guesses and may not be accurate.
  * Display dimmed time estimate field if there is no estimate available.
  * -e switch renamed to -r and forces both estimates on.

    if that info is not available from the machine.
  * Add -r switch to force wmbattery to estimate the time left.

wmbattery (2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Deal with acpi putting nothing but "Present: no" in the info file for the
    second battery of a thinkpad. This was with kernel 2.4.19-pre10.
    Closes: #149715
  * Moved DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS out of makeinfo.

wmbattery (2.09) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 31 May 2002 21:35:06 -0400

wmbattery (2.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added symbolic apm info constants to "apm.h", in case they are
    not in the system <apm.h>.
  * Put $(LIBS) last at link time.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Apr 2002 11:49:16 -0400

wmbattery (2.06) unstable; urgency=low

wmbattery (2.04) unstable; urgency=low

    now works.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Apr 2002 22:49:43 -0400

wmbattery (2.03) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Apr 2002 17:48:41 -0400

wmbattery (2.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected minus sign in bigfont to proper faux-lcd appearance. Also fixed

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Apr 2002 23:34:38 -0500

wmbattery (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ACPI support, including battery change detection, and battery
    charging time countdown timer.
  * Added -w parameter to configure delay time.
  * Added -c and -l parameters to allow user control of battery low/critical
    percentages.
  * Use constant defs from apm.h instead of nasty hardcoded numbers.
  * Made -Wall clean.
  * Reorg.
  * Removed -s option, just fall back to SPIC if ACPI and APM are not
    available.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Apr 2002 12:53:18 -0500

wmbattery (1.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for querying for battery status via the sonypi driver, for
    sony laptops that do not have apm support. This is a stopgap until linux
    gets full ACPI support.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Apr 2002 10:25:31 -0500

wmbattery (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Converted to use libapm, instead of the hacked up old version of it
    used before. This probably breaks wmbattery on the BSD's, for now. The
    correct fix for the BSD's will be to get support for their apm
    implementations into libapm. To that end, I have filed a bug with all the
    code I ripped out.
  * The -f option also had to be removed. If libapm does not work right on
    systems that needed that flag it's probably a bug in the library.
  * Closes: #100027

wmbattery (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Edward Betts <edward@debian.org> to make the icon redraw
    immediatly when it gets an expose event. The patch also lowers the CPU
    time used as the icon is not needlessly redrawn every second. Thanks
    Edward! Closes: #97779
  * Battery blink fixup. (I seem to have inexplicably lost the changelog
    and version involving making the battery blink red on and off when the
    status is critical -- I did this recently because the eye tends to
    notice the motion).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 May 2001 13:16:55 -0400
