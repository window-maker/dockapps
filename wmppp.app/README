Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
WMPPP features all things the standard pppd offers and gives
you some nice additional features too...

        * Integrated online timer;
        * Integrated modem RX/TX LED's;
		* Integrated WMPPP status LED; 
        * Integrated autoscaling PPP transfer statistics;
		* Integrated CARRIER/CONNECT display;
		* Integrated bytes/second Speed-O-Meter;
		* Automatic detection of active ppp interfaces;
		* User definable scripts for the V and X buttons and
  		  also for 'ifdown' which are read from ~/.wmppprc;
		* 'force' option in /etc/ppp/.wmppprc for sites
  		  where users are not allowed to mess with pppd;
		* Several commandline options (try '-h' for help);

WMPPP is being developped on DEC Alpha machines running Linux
(RedHat-5.0 and RedHat-5.1), but WMPPP is also intensively 
tested on x86 and m68k Linux machines...
