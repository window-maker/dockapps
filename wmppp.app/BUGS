Known 'features and easter eggs' in WMPPP,
(or in non M$ talk, BUGS).

WMPPP 1.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------
	* Brand new release, WMPPP almost is completely rewritten
	  since the last release, no 'known' bugs yet;
	

WMPPP/WMiFS 1.2p1
--------------------------------------------------------------

	* WMPPP: The -t parameter dumps core on some systems,
		 we're looking into this.
	* WMPPP: SEGV when running it as user (reported once)
		 we can't reproduce it here, but we're looking
		 into this.
	* WMPPP: "ifdown:" gets executed when pressing V button,
		 (reported once), we also can't reproduce this
		 one, but we're looking into this.
	* WMPPP: ppp0 is still hardcoded (sigh), will be fixed.
	* WMiFS: SEGV with the dummy interface, we're looking
		 into this (needs to be ignored like lo). 
	* WMiFS: Manages to get X CPU usage way to high on
		 some systems somehow (reported myself) :)

	* Special thanks to Marcelo <mmagallo@efis.ucr.ac.cr>
	  for providing some real usefull patches for WMPPP,
	  they will be in the next update for sure!  

 
WMPPP/WMiFS 1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------
	
	* The pixmap 'shift' in AfterStep's Wharf seems
	  not to be our fault, but a bug in Wharf!
 	
	  Please notify the authors of AfterStep about
	  this if you like to see this fixed, Wharf can't
	  handle pixmaps that are larger than 60x60 pixels
	  very well :(
	
	* Most code is yet again quite rewritten, but we
	  think all previous annoyances are gone now ;-)

Note: The configuration GUI is no longer supported,
everything is done with user definable .rc files
now, so we've scrapped it from the BUG list


WMPPP/WMiFS 1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------

	* most of the below bugs are dealth with
	  and/or made obsolete with 1.1.
	* None 'known' bugs for 1.1 so far ;-)

WMPPP 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------

        * wmppp-start has to be in /etc/ppp
        * wmppp-stop has to be in /etc/ppp
        * only ppp0 will be read
        * the leds won't be reliable with
          more than 1 ppp connection
        * there is an iconwin, and win variable.
          I have no clue why only win shouldn't
          be enough. Will check it out later.
        * The afterstep wharf seems to shift the
          pixmap a bit. Don't know how and why.
          It works perfectly with WindowManager :)
        * the configuration GUI doesn't return
          configured values from /etc/ppp/options
          yet, when you start the configuration
          GUI it presents the default parameters.
