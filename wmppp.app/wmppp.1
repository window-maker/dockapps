The program that starts the connection
.TP
.I stop

whole \"CONNECT\" line the modem outputs.
.TP
.I ifdown
This program is run if the line goes down, and the \fIstop\fP program
hasn't been run. (Redial program)
.TP
.I stampfile
The modification time of this file is used to calculate the amount of
time the connection has been up. Something like \fItouch <stampfile>\fP
should be run for this to work.
.SH FILES
.TP
/var/run/wmppp.\fIppp0\fP
this is the stamp file use to determine the amount of time enlapsed
since the connection came up. This file should be managed by the ip-up
and ip-down scripts. On Debian systems, \fI/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00wmppp\fP
creates the file, and \fI/etc/ppp/ip-down.d/00wmppp\fP removes it.
