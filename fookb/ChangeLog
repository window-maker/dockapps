4.0

Now maintained by the Window Maker Team.

Rename configure.in -> configure.ac.

Use pkg-config to check for libraries.

Use automake

Rename VERSION to more standard ChangeLog.

Make WUtil required instead of optional.

Remove trailing whitespace.

Fix error handling when reading XPM files.  Previously, we would try and read
the width and height of images read from an XPM file *before* doing any error
handling to determine whether we successfully read the file in the first place.
If there had been an error, then there would be a segfault.

Port to libdockapp.  In addition to the obvious simplification to the code by
removing all the window creation stuff, this also allows us to let users pick
whether they want to run fookb as a dockapp or as a normal windowed application
at runtime using libdockapp's --windowed command line option.  Previously, this
was done during build using configure's --enable-wmaker option.

Use libdockapp instead of X resource manager for command line options.

Remove --enable-wmaker compile-time option.  Now that we use libdockapp's
--windowed option to allow users to choose whether to run fookb as a dockapp or
as a normal windowed application at runtime, the --enable-wmaker option compile
~/GNUstep/Defaults and it printed a warning message when users used large icon
files.  We now use the ~/.fookb config file in all instances and always print
the warning message.

Add desktop entry file.

Remove out-of-date check.sh script and empty test/foo file.

Update INSTALL.

Update manpage.  In addition to accounting for the various changes in the new
version, we also rename from the deprecated 1x section to just 1 and get the
current version number from autoconf.

3.1

An idea (icon size is now configurable) and two icons from "Andrei M. Soukharev"
<A.M.Suharev@inp.nsk.su>.

Now I use subversion.

3.0-unstable

configure.in rewritten almost from scratch.

Starting from version 0.70 Window Maker does not contain libproplist anymore;
so fookb now DOES NOT SUPPORT libproplist. You will get the same functionality
with libWUtil (part of Window Maker).

lint is still unhappy.

And the most important thing -- author's email was changed everywhere.

2.21-unstable

One more step to the lint happiness.
Some #include:s added. Why did it work before???

2.20-unstable

LICENSE was changed! Please read.

--enable/disable-libproplist/wmaker options for configure.
Some cosmetic changes to make lint happy (he's still very sad).
Makefile.in was simplified (of course configure.in has some complex changes).

2.13

Seems to be stable version. Minor cosmetic changes.

2.12-unstable

Final (I hope) fixes in Makefile.in for non-proplist version.

2.11-unstable

Small error in Makefine.in for non-proplist version was fixed.

2.1-unstable

libPropList-free version. Command line parameters. X resource
management. ``configure'' script. I hope non-WindowMaker version still
work?

0.9
New icons for Xkb groups. Nasty bug was fixed: fookb plays sound twice
if you change locked Xkb group with mouse. Documentation updates.
0.8
Fookb now can play sounds.
0.7
No more #define pixmaps. Configuration file in use.
0.6
No more #define NUMG
0.5
XpmReadFileToImage error check added.
0.4
No more ass. Window Maker support happened. I hope fookb still work
w/o -DWMAKER.
0.3
The ass. Intended to be Window Maker support.
0.2
Support for all 4 Xkb groups
0.1
Basic functionality
