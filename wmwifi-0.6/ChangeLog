	* Version 0.5
	* Displays current Access Point for each interface
	* Merged wifi_info() and get_max_qual() into get_wifi_info(),
	  which gets alot more wireless info.
	* Added a bit of code to try and detect your quality
	  if you are using driver which do not report the max_qual
	  properly to the wireless extensions (i.e., ndiswrapper, prism54).
	* Changed middle mouse click from previous interface to toggle
	  view of Link/Level/Noise/Bitrate.

	* Added "get_max_qual" to get the maximum quality directly from
	  the wireless extension in the kernel instead of assuming it
	  would always be 92, which isn't the case. This means that
	  quality reporting is now accurate.

	* Changes the "look" of the display.
	* wmwifi now exits if it cannot open the wireless extensions.
