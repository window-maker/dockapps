  3/24/1998  --  First release, wrote this yesterday, so it may have 
                 some bugs.
  3/25/1998  --  added logarithmic scaling.  
                 some touch ups on the updateSpeedometer() to be a 
                   little more helpful
                 added a little more width to the speedometer display
                    from a report that the text sometimes was drawn off
                    the scale (couldnt confirm, is it fixed?)
                 fixed prob for speeds > 9.9 megabytes per second (I 
                    think... I can't go that fast myself 
                 Made default maxspeed 6000 which I assume is better 
                    for modems.
  5/11/1998  --  I witnessed the little problem with the speedometer 
                    going off into the main window so I set a clipmask
                    Still don't understand how it could go off..I'm 
                    using a fixed size font...
  5/13/1998  --  Modified the way it gets its stats from /proc/net/ip_acct
                    You now have to give it explicit accounting rule numbers
                    through the -T and -R options or else it defaults to the
                    fist two in tx, rx order, best just to make sure
                    you  set the -T and -R options.
  5/15/1998  --  Completed interface rewrite, definitely have more graphing 
                    space, but I dont know if I like it yet.
  5/16/1998  --  Added shaded graphs, xload style.  Its a lot prettier! 
  8/6/1998   --  Put in the stat driver interface and some drivers
  5/4/2000   --  Added support for OpenBSD, thanks to Vladimir Popov
