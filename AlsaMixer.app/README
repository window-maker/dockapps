Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
AlsaMixer.app is a mixer utility for Linux systems with ALSA sound driver.
It is designed to be docked in Window Maker (and other wms). This utility has
three volume controllers that can be configured to handle any sound source,
he default sources are 'Master', 'PCM' and 'CD' volume. Sound sources can be
easily muted and there is also wheel mouse support.
The whole GUI and command parsing was taken from Mixer.app (see old doc
for URL's), only connection to ALSA driver was added.


Hints
--------------------------------------------------------------
Error led:
	If the led on Mixer.app is red an error message has
	been printed to stderr and something is not working
	correctly. If the led is green everything is working ok.
	(Error led doesn't work in AlsaMixer.app, TODO)

Mute:
	Right click on a volume controller to mute the sound
	source. The button will then have a red led in one corner.
	Right click again to restore the volume. If a muted sound
	source is modified by another application Mixer.app will
	automaticaly release its muted state.

Wheel mouse:
	If you have a wheel mouse (where the wheel is configured as
	Button4 and Button5) you can control the volume by just moving
	the mouse over Mixer.app and roll the wheel up and down. Use
	the command line option -w to specify which slider that should
	react to the wheel movement.

Label:
	If you run multiple instances of AlsaMixer.app you might want
	to be able to tell them apart. This can easily be done
	by setting a label to each one of them. By using the -l
	option you can add a little text label at the bottom of
	the mixer.

Save volume settings:
	Use the option -S (and -f <file>) if you want the volume
	settings to be saved when AlsaMixer.app exits, and then
	-L to be loaded again when AlsaMixer.app is started the next time.
	When not using -f the settings are saved in/loaded from
	~/GNUstep/Defaults/AlsaMixer. Use the -f <file> option
	if you want to use a different file.
	(TODO: mute states aren't saved/loaded)

Configurable middle click:
	By default, when you middle click anywhere inside application
	window, app tries to load default mixer setting from default
	or explicitly configured (-f) file. If file doesn't exist,
	nothing happens.
	You can also configure AlsaMixer.app to run command (i.e.
	better mixer) on middle click by using -e <command> option.
