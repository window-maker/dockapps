	* INSTALL: Updated compiler and flags example.

	* wmclock.c, weekday.xpm: Integrated Debian nopolling patch and
	FreeBSD's weekday and year patches. Added function prototypes.

	* wmclock.spec.in: Bumped version to 1.0.13, changed ExecPrefix to
	/usr/local since /usr/X11R6 is obsolete.

	oyd11 at softhome.net

	Deanovic <djosip at croadria.com>

	* Imakefile: `tar' target was copying CVS directories.
	Restructured it a bit to avoid that.

	* Imakefile: `distclean' target could prove troublesome by
	destroying irreproducible work.

	* wmclock.spec.in: Oops.  Missed an obsolete %%{ReleaseNum} macro.

2000-03-08 07:35  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, wmclock.spec.in: Added template from which to generate
	spec file (wmclock.spec.in).  Added targets in Imakefile to handle
	generating the spec file.  Revised `tar' target to rebuild on
	sourcefile change.  Added distclean target.  Removed symlinks from
	tarball.  Updated version to 1.0.12.1.

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore file for convenience of the
	developer.

	* Makefile: Makefile is automagically generated; it shouldn't be
	stored in CVS.

	* wmclock.c, xpm/mask.xbm: Compiling with gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic
	revealed that the mask bitmap should be declared as unsigned char.
	XCreateBitmapFromData() expects char *, though, so we cast the mask
	bitmap data explicitly.

	* dynlist.c, dynlist.h: Fixed possible memory leak.
