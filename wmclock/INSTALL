|O|  Installing wmclock  |X|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The procedure for installing wmclock is relatively simple.

  (1) Create the `configure' script:

          autoreconf -i

  (2) Run the `configure' script to configure the language support that
      is built into wmclock.  For example:

          ./configure --with-lang=english

      For a list of the available languages, use:

          ./configure --help

      Note that if no language it given, `english' is chosen as the default.

  (3) Compile:

          make

      You may specify the C compiler to use and additional command-line
      options for the C compiler using the `CC' and `CFLAGS'
      variables, respectively.  For example:

          make CC=clang CFLAGS='-O4 -march=pentium2'


  (4) Test wmclock:

          ./wmclock

      (If it appears to work as expected, *don't dock it*.  Wait until
      after you've installed it).

  (5) Install:

          su
          make install

  (6) You're done.  See the README file accompanying this one for
      instructions on installing wmclock into Window Maker's dock.
