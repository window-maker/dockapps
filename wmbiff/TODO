This is not a prioritized list.  Patches that accomplish
these todo items are welcome.

* Config file rewrite
  The current configuration file has the following problems
** # comments make #'s unsuitable for passwords.
** : and @ delimiters make such characters unsuitable for
   passwords.
** the hierarchical configuration is not exported cleanly, 
   setting a default and then propagating or overriding it
   requires an odd syntax.
** elements with spaces are problematic
** annotations / customizations (such as the authentication
   methods) are cumbersome.
** continuation lines would allow richer shell actions without
   external shell scripts.
* GNUTLS 0.5.9 
** adds gnutls_set_default_priority, which could clean up 
   a lot of the code to set priorities for ciphers that
   don't really matter to wmbiff.
* Font support
** Erase counts > 1000 successfully (redraw the whole line)
** Discover height of the font, scale appropriately.
** Draw relative to symbolic width, height.
* Finish checking .wmbiffrc permissions.
  With shell command execution support, it is even more
  important to protect against other/group writability.
  With passwords in the .wmbiffrc, .wmbiffrc shouldn't be
  readable.  It might be best to complain all the time, but
  only abort when a password is used from a readable file,
  or a shell command is executed from a writable file.
* Better timeout handling
  Sometimes my IMAP server is slow... well, it's my fault
  that I keep a few thousand messages on it.  The current
  timeout code will cause it to fail prematurely.
* Generic constructors for mboxes.  
  There's some common code across different Clients;
  this is one piece that could use refactoring.
* Add more shell "recipes" besides gicu.
  Just added 'finger'.  I'm hoping to add something to
  integrate 'remind' just as soon as I can figure it out.
* Support on/off status LED's, for, for example,
  grep eth0 /proc/net/dev | wc -l
  The colored LED's are already in WMBiff's pixmap.
* Support buttons 4 and 5
  The mousewheel could be useful for some behaviors, like
  controlling volume, or selecting different mailboxes.
* Use a helper program to blink keyboard led's.
  Requires killing the 'notify' program when new mail no
  longer exists.  Keyboard blinking is done via a helper
  program because it requires root.  ledcontrol seems ok,
  but extra complicated, and has a useless default install
  that requires root.  xbuffy's led program seems quite
  good, but depending on another biff program seems odd.
* Add a failure-expect case in tlsComm. 
  For example, an IMAP status query has a good response (*
  STATUS) and a bad response (a003 NO STATUS).  As soon as
  one of them is received, we're done.
* Reload .wmbiffrc when it changes
  This is straightforward, except for IMAP mailboxes that
  keep a connection to the server open.  A close function
  will have to be implemented to shut those down gracefully.
  Do not involve sighup or any other signals.  Use or
  improve fileHasChanged().
* Runtime back-tick expansion for non-mbox
  Because interesting mailboxes can be defined by date,
  though its not clear any other clients can take advantage.
* Support GSSAPI or SASL authentication
  Authentication using krb5 would be sweet.

* Unlikely to get done, unless someone volunteers:
* KDE/Gnome users: Test with KDE or gnome-panel
  Does Debian bug #108529 apply to wmbiff?  Can wmbiff
  be swallowed by gnome-panel?  It seems possible.  It 
  appears to be swallowed by FVWM correctly.
* Autoconf / Automake Wizards: fix FromCVS.sh
  How best to deal with libgnutls's macros?  All 
  I can do is hack.
* Paranoid Pop People: Support POP over TLS.
  tlsComm.c should make it easy to provide TLS support
  for POP.  Unfortunately, this would only be useful for
  someone who has such a server that doesn't support IMAPS.
* MH support
  Try "path.n=shell:::ls -1 directoryname | wc -l".
  If it works, tell us.  Optionally the patch at sourceforge
  could be integrated.
* Recursive maildir support
  Aggregation in general is an oft-desired feature.
* G-Mail support 
  Though the business model of free mail forces screen scrubbing,
  having someone else write and maintain the interface seems 
  like it would significantly improve the utility of gmail.
