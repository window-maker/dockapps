   WMBiff is an WindowMaker docking utility, that displays number of
   total messages count or unread mail messages count in differrent
   mailboxes.

   WMBiff was created by Gennady Belyakov in 1999, and was continued by
   a team of volunteers after his death.

   Green ( cyan? :) ) digits display total number of messages, if there
   are no unread messages in it.

   Yellow digits display number of unread messages, with blinking on new
   mail arrival, if any.

   At this moment unix-style (mbox), maildir, POP3, APOP and IMAP mailboxes
   are supported. WMBiff also understands Licq's history files.
   WMBiff supports up to 5 mailboxes (but you can start 2 or more
   wmbiff's with differrent configs).

   Pressing on a 1st (left) mouse button will execute appropriate mail
   reader (if defined in config file). Right-clicking will exec mail
   fetching program (if any).

   It is also possible to execute user-defined command line on new mail
   arrival (for example, play .WAV file).

                          Compiling and Installation

Extract the archive:
        tar -xvzf wmbiff-0.x.tar.gz

Enter the wmbiff directory and follow INSTALL's directions.
        cd wmbiff-0.x/
        ./configure

For crypto support either:
 *) Install gnutls and libgrcypt packages from your distribution.
 *) Download them from http://www.gnupg.org/(en)/download/mirrors.html
   Choose a mirror, then download from the alpha/gnutls and
   alpha/libgcrypt directories.
 *) Do nothing; the configure script will note its absence.

NOTE: gnutls-0.3.5 is the version that this release was
tested with.  Newer versions may have incompatible changes.

Make the binary:
        make

Install the binary:
        make install

This will copy the binary to /usr/local/bin

Then you need to copy sample.wmbiffrc into your home directory as
.wmbiffrc, correct it as you like. Or, you can use the ``-c'' option
and specify differrent name of config file.
 Without any config file wmbiff will use only default mailbox
(from environment variable MAIL), labeled with word SPOOL, at first
position. All other positions will be empty.

UPDATE [2001-06-18]:

On Tuesday, 22 May 2001, Jordi Mallach sent the following email to the
wmbiff-devel list:

    Hello,
    I just found evidence of what I had believed for a long time.

    http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive/ports/0101/msg00311.html

    Gennady Belyakov passed away right after releasing 0.2 and when he
    stopped answering mail :|

    I guess we need to update the docs.

Here is the message, if that URL becomes unavailable:

    Well, wmbiff's author Gennady Belyakov passed away in late November 1999.
    That's why that url isn't any longer valid.

May your soul rest in peace, Gennady.
