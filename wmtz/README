Author....:     Jan Lindblom <99jl@home.se>

Note......:     Since I'm a very lazy programmer, I ripped
                most of the code from the excellent WMiNET
		program. See credits below...

Credits...:     
                Patch for local date, local time, weekday and @, and
                some code clean-ups:

                Patch for Swatch beats:
                  Joris van Gasteren <fuzzy@nala.demon.nl>

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
wmtz is a Window Maker dock app derived from the WMiNET
dock app. It displays the local time from different time zones
defined in the configuration file. It can also display the
current Julian Day Number as well as Swatch beats and  
sidereal time at Greenwich and local sidereal time and 
local time, date and weekday.

This app can be useful (?) for people who have to communicate 
in realtime with people from different time zones. It allows 
you to avoid making a fool of yourself by calling someone 
when they are asleep...
