	* src/power_management/power_management.c (calculate_battery_time):
	When calculating battery time directly, make wmpower reinitialize its
	stuff also when the time elapsed since our last update is significantly
	higher than our polling interval, because this likely means that
	the system has been suspended (we allow it some play -60 seconds-
	because -who knows- the system might be on really heavy load)
