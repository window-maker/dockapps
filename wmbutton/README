dock in WindowMaker, can be swallowed by Wharf in Afterstep, and
should be fairly configurable.

                  Modified wmbutton to asbutton.
                  Note: asbutton is a seperate program, not associated 
                        with wmbutton (just as wmbutton is not associated
                        with wmcp)

The contributors listed above are not necessarily involved with the 
development of wmbutton.  I'm listing them here partially as thanks for 
helping out, catching bugs in the code, etc.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
	Untar the file: 
		tar xvzf wmbutton-0.6.1.tar.gz

	CD to source directory:  
		cd wmbutton-0.6.1

	Edit background xpm, and buttons.xpm to your preferences
	There are icon files in ./icons to work from

	Compile it:
	 	make clean; make

	Copy the config file:
		cp .wmbutton ~

	Put the executable somewhere in your path:
		mv wmbutton /usr/local/bin (or anyhere in your path)
	
	Run it:
		wmbutton &

	Grab the appicon and move it to the dock. 
	Change the settings to start with Windowmaker

	Afterstep Wharf 1.6.??:
	*Wharf wmbutton -Swallow "wmbutton" wmbutton &

    ***Note***: 
	The appicon has only a two pixel border where you can grab 
	and move it.

	If make doesn't work, you may need to fiddle with the settings in 
	the Makefile.

	Tested on: (Well, it runs, I don't know if 'Tested' is quite right...)
		WindowMaker-0.80.1
		Afterstep 1.6.?
		Fluxbox 0.9.9
		Clients: Red Hat 8.x, Kernel 2.4.18


USAGE:
------
wmbutton [-g geom] [-d dpy] [-f cfgfile] [-b btnfile] [-F <font>] 
	 [-v] [-s] [-n]

NOTES:
------
This is a simple application launching tool for use in WindowMaker, and 
possibly Afterstep.  (Who knows, it should run for other window managers too, 
by why bother??  It is taken from wmcp, by Ben Cohen, and modified just
enough to run applications rather than send ALT-[1..9] key sequences to 
WindowMaker.  It has also taken some ideas from asbuttons, and
included them back into the original.  There may still be some code
left over from wmcp that is no longer needed, but...  

The mini-icons must be combined into a single graphic, buttons.xpm.  The 
background border is defined in backdrop.xpm.  Both must be edited in your
favorite graphics editor (GIMP??), and then recompiled.  wmbuttons uses a
configuration file (usually ~/.wmbutton) for which applications to launch.
There is no need to restart wmbuttons when simply changing the configuration, 
as wmbutton searches the file whenever a button is pressed.

As of release 0.5, you can also pass in your own pixmap file for the
buttons, to override the buttons that are compiled it.  This file should
still have the same height and width so that it will make sense,
though really you give it any XPM you want, but it will only display
the upper left 54x54 pixel corner.


An example file is included, related to the the buttons.xpm graphic file.


CHANGE LOG:
-----------
0.6.1 Minor changes to the Makefile.
0.6 Code cleanup and fixes for memory leaks by Christian 'Greek0' Aichinger.
0.5	Added Modifications submitted by Ralf Horstmann.
	  Load different pixmaps at start-up time, rather than having
	  to compile them in.  This also makes it much easier to run
	  multiple copies.
	Added Modifications submitted by Michael Cohrs.
	  Added Tool-Tips
	Updated default buttons.xpm graphics
	General Code clean-up, including export must functions to
	  seperate C file, to reduce clutter.

0.4	Added Modifications submitted by Casey Harkins. 
	  Start application on mouse button release, 
	  Only start app if cursor is still on application button
	  Added 3-D button press look
	Added new .wmbutton configuration file

0.3	Graphics changed to incorporate most changes made by asbutton
	Removed Middle/Right mouse click on button to turn off buttons
	  after it.
	Added Middle and Right mouse buttons to run more Applications
	  (Yes, you can now really run 27 different Apps from a single 
	  instance of wmbuttons, if you would want too...)
	Fixed bug for finding config file .wmbutton.
	  It used to not look in the home directory, but in the
	  startup directory.  Thanks to Casey harkins for the fix.
	Included the icons directory from the asbutton distribution,
	  plus a few more.

0.2	Added single configuration file, user selectable.

0.1	Origional version.
	  Shamelessly taken from wmcp 1.2.5, 
	  by Ben Cohen <buddog@aztec.asu.edu>

TODO:
-----
Add ability (via config file) to use discrete 16x16 pixel icons for
  the buttons, rather than having to paste them all into the existing file.
Make changing icons and/or background graphics easier.
Allow for less than 9 icons, 4 would be nicer on the mini-icon size.

BUGS: 
-----
Remember, they're just undocumented FEATURES!!!

Probably Lots.  Send comments (preferably with fixes) to
<ehf_dockapps@cox.net>


Good Luck.
