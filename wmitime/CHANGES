Version		Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
0.5		* wmitime uses now the new library libdockapp that includes the
		  old wmgeneral library.
		* Add note about libdockapp to README.

0.4		* Update GPL text and Free Software Foundation address.
		* Remove trailing whitespace.
		* Allow -display option with no argument.  Previously, if a user
		  ran wmitime with the -display option and no argument, a
		  segmentation fault would occur. Print a warning instead.
		  (Patch from Debian to fix bug #716466.)
		* Update Makefile.  In particular,
		  - Remove reference to deprecated X11R6 directory.
		  - Replace FLAGS variable with CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS.
		  - Honor CC, PREFIX, and DESTDIR variables.
		  - Use INSTALL instead of cp for installation.
		  - Remove redundant -lXext flag.
		  - Move contents of wmitime directory to top directory to ease
		    the building process.
		* Improve locale support.  Previously, wmitime only had support
		  for English, French, and (in Debian only) Hungarian.	In
		  addition, the choice was made at compile time.
		  Add run-time support for any language using the Latin
		  alphabet.  The locale is determined by the user's environment
		  or may be specified on the command line with the "-l" option.
		  Note that users whose environment specifies a non-Latin locale
		  may wish to use, e.g., "-l C", as otherwise no date will
		  appear.
		  Note that, for simplicity, the month and day are now displayed
		  as "01 JAN" as opposed to "JAN 01".  (Previously, the former
		  format was used for English and the latter for French.)
		* Remove C++ style comments.
		* Remove references to config file in source; nonexistent
		  feature.
		* Update contact information.  wmitime is now maintained by the
		  Window Maker Developers Team
		  <wmaker-dev@googlegroups.com>.
		* Add manpage and desktop file, both adapted from Debian.
		* Remove wmitime-master-led.xpm; unused duplicate file.
		* Do not include or compile unused wmgeneral files.

0.3		* fixed inet time calculation error (oops :) )
 		  (thanks to Martijn van de Streek <tweakr@tap.xs4all.nl>
		* Added french support
                  (thanks to Pierre-Marie Allemand <Pierre-Marie.Allemand@capway.com> )


0.2		* Fixed AM/PM mode bug... noon or midnight would
		  show up as '0:00'.. doh.
		* Made the day abbrev 2 letters and the month 3
                  due to popular request :)
		* Fixed potentially fatal (but rare) /0 bug...
                  wheee :)

0.1
		* First initial public release.
