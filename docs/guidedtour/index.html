<h2><strong>Foreword</strong></h2>

This tutorial is intended to help Window Maker users gain knowledge
about the many excellent features
of this window manager.&nbsp; The official Users Guide is worth reading. It can
be reached from the <a href="http://windowmaker.org/guide_toc.php">Window
Maker site</a>.&nbsp;
Other guides, tutorials and tips can be found at various sites on the
internet.&nbsp; An
internet search for "Window Maker guide how-to" might provide
additional worthwhile information. <br>

<br>

This guided tour is NOT supposed to be a README, INSTALL or FAQ . These
are worth reading, or more accurately, they should be considered COMPULSORY reading.
<br>

<br>

The information in the guided tour is based upon Window Maker version 0.95.3.
Check your version by opening WPrefs.app (the Window Maker Preferences
tool). The version number is shown in the initial WPrefs window just
below the "Window Maker Preferences" title. You may also run the
command "<span style="font-style: italic;">wmaker --version</span>" in
a terminal (without the quotation marks). This command returns the installed version number of Window Maker.
<br>

<h2><strong>A special word of thanks</strong></h2>

The original Window Maker Guided Tour site was created and maintained
for many years by Georges Tarbouriech. Where possible, I have retained
his original work - including the layout and structure of the pages,
the descriptions of Window Maker features,
and even some of his original graphics. I want these pages to be up-to-date,
but I also want them to be (as much as possible) a continuation
of Georges' work. <span style="font-style: italic;">Thank you, Georges</span>.
(Having said that, anything you
find in error is without question my fault - so don't blame Georges
for any mistakes!)
If you find an error, have a suggestion, or wish to make a comment, you may contact me by email at <span style="font-style: italic;">bnance&lt;atsigngoeshere&gt;uu.edu</span>.<br>

<br>

This tour will attempt to follow Window Maker development, but not
every update can be taken into account.&nbsp; In other words, this
tour can help you learn the basics, but does not pretend to provide all
of the detail or all of the latest information available in the
official README, INSTALL and FAQ documents provided by Window Maker
developers and maintainers.<br>
