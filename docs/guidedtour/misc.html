<h2><a name="loc">Localization</a></h2>

As soon as Window Maker is compiled with some options and gettext
installed, it
is fully localizable. Check the INSTALL file. <br>

However, localization of menus can be used without the LANG environment
variable
set. Using pl menu allows to get menus in any available language
without setting
this variable. <br>

Why do such a "thing" instead of setting the localization the "right"
way? <br>

For some reasons users may want to keep the system default language
instead of
defining a new localization. One of the main reason is that most
software doesn't
exist in all languages. <br>

<h2><a name="font">Fonts</a></h2>

It's possible to change the fonts in Window Maker, editing the
WindowMaker file
or the WMGLOBAL file in ~/GNUstep/Defaults. <br>

Once again the INSTALL file gives instructions on how to do it. <br>

The specific file to edit varies according to the fonts to be changed. <br>

The script <span style="font-style: italic;">wsetfont</span> is
provided to do the job.
<h2><a name="util">Utilities</a></h2>

Window Maker provides the user with some useful utilities. <br>

There is a README file concerning these scripts in the util directory. <br>

Almost each script has it's own man page recommended reading. <br>

These utilities mainly concern the GUI: icons, styles, fonts, menus,
backgrounds. <br>

A few of them deserve special interest as many users don't seem to know
about them. <br>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">wdwrite</span> script, for
instance, writes data into the
configuration
files. <br>

The <span style="font-style: italic;">setstyle</span> (or <span style="font-style: italic;">getstyle</span>) scripts are used to
manage themes. <br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Wxcopy</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">wxpaste</span> allows copying and pasting
using the X cutbuffer. <br>

The first one makes part of the default applications menu, in the
selection
item. <br>

For KDE users, wkdemenu.pl is worth using. <br>

From version 0.63.0 on, a new utility is available : <span style="font-style: italic;">wmagnify</span>. It allows magnification
of the area under the mouse pointer.<br>
