Installation instructions for WMiFS. 


NOTE!
--------------------------------------------------------------
Installing this program requires root privileges, ask your 
local system/network administrator kindly if she/he wants
to install this software for you ;-)


Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------
- root access

	To be able to complete the installation you'll need
	to make changes in the system's /etc directory,
	the installation copies the GLOBAL config file
	there, don't worry, nothing will be overwritten ;-)


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1)  % tar -zxvf wmifs-1.3b.tar.gz
2)* % cd wmifs.app/wmifs
3)  % make 
4)  % su root
5)  # make install
6)* # vi ~/.wmifsrc and/or /etc/wmifsrc
	set up the paths to your pppd
	start, stop & restart scripts
7)  % wmifs & (or wmifs -h for brief help).

2)* If you're on a libc5 system, copy or move wmifs-libc5.c
    over wmifs.c (i.e. cp wmifs-libc5.c wmifs.c) and proceed
    with step 3)

6)* This is optional, WMiFS also works fine without them,
    it's entirely up to you ;-)


    
Extra Install Info For Site Administrators!
--------------------------------------------------------------
For site administrators who don't want their users messing
up pppd's configuration files, WMiFS now supports an 
/etc/wmifsrc.fixed file. 

The installation will install the normal user and global 
wmifsrc files in $HOME and /etc, NOT the fixed one!

WMiFS scan for 3 files at startup, in the following order:

	1. /etc/wmifsrc
	2. $HOME/.wmifsrc
	3. /etc/wmifsrc.fixed
	
If no .wmifsrc file is found in the users home directory,
WMiFS will use the global one (/etc/wmifsrc, if present 
and valid).

When WMiFS finds a /etc/wmifs.fixed file, all settings
that WMiFS detected in /etc/wmifsrc and/or $HOME/.wmifsrc
will be discarted i.e. OVERRIDDEN! 

If you want your users to be able to dialout, but you 
don't want them to mess around, simply move or copy
the default /etc/wmifsrc to /etc/wmifsrc.fixed :)

Note: When NO wmifsrc files are found at all, WMiFS will
work, but quite obvious, WMiFS won't launch any scripts.
Make sure there are valid and FULL pathnames in the wmifsrc
file(s) if you want WMiFS to launch your pppd scripts ;-)


Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------
WMiFS support the following commandline options:

        -h              helpscreen
        -display        X server display where wmppp should
                        appear (default = 0:0)
	-i		interface name, note: 'lo' can ONLY
			be specified with '-i lo' ;-)
			(default = default interface as it
			 appears in /proc/net/route) 
	-w		draw the statistics graph in waveform
			like mode, try it! (default = normal)
        -v              print wmifs version number


General Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------
Note 1: If "make install" fails on your system, please edit
        the Makefile to set the paths according to your setup.
        "make install" defaults to /usr/local/bin, $HOME & /etc.

Note 2: Please DO read the HINTS, this file contains some
        very usefull tips about WMiFS.
