Version         Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.9	* Released 180627

	* Error handling when fopen fails.
	  This prevents fgets from segfaulting on the next line, closing Debian
	  bug #901353.
	  Thanks to <anomie@users.sourceforge.net> for the bug report and patch.

1.8	* Released 160420

	* Display version number from configure.ac with -v option.

	* Fix typos.  Ran `codespell -w .`.

1.7	* Released 160419

	* Fix buffer overflow if interface has name > 8 characters.
	  Patch by anomie@users.sourceforge.net to fix Debian bug #805519. [1]

	* Switch to autotools for build.

	* Add desktop entry file.

	* Update INSTALL after switch to autotools.

1.6	* Released 150824

	* wmifs uses now the new library libdockapp that includes the old
	  wmgeneral library.

	* Add note about libdockapp to INSTALL.

1.5	* Released 150527

	* Include latest version of wmgeneral library.

	* Move source files to top directory.

	* Fix spelling error and escape hyphen in manpage. Based on a patch in
	  the Debian package [1].

	* Fix "variable 'ppp_old" set but not used" compiler warning. Based on a
	  patch from the Debian package [2].

	* Update Makefile. In particular,
	  - Drop unnecessary definition of DESTDIR.
	  - Drop LIBDIR; pointed to deprecated X11R6 directory.
	  - Honors CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS build flags.
	  - Remove out-of-date version number from installation message.
	  Based in part on a patch from the Debian package [3].

	* Fix "suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement" compiler
	  warning.

	* Fix "comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions"
	  compiler warning.

	* Fix "overflow in implicit constant conversion" compiler warnings.

	* Replace deprecated caddr_t with void *.

	* Replace deprecated usleep with nanosleep. Although defining
	  _DEFAULT_SOURCE is overkill for nanosleep, it also fixes "field ‘b’
	  has incomplete type" errors, as we need __USE_MISC defined to pick up
	  the definition of ifreq in <net/if.h>.

	* Add -c command line option allowing users to set color.

	* Reformat help text for readability.

	* Add support for wmgeneral's -geometry command line option. Also take
	  the opportunity to correct the manpage; the -d option should be
	  -display.

	* Honor CONF Makefile variable when parsing system config files.

	* Don't ignore geometry strings beginning with '-'.

	* Throw out first /proc/net/dev reading. If we keep it, we start with a
	  huge spike and everything else is zero until the spike finally leaves
	  the window several moments later.

	 * Tidy #includes using include-what-you-use.

	 * Reduce scopes of variables (fixes style warnings from cppcheck).

	 * Convert strtok() calls to thread-safe strtok_r().

	 * Add proper copyright header.

	 * Update Window Maker instructions in HINTS.

	 * Remove first two installation steps in INSTALL. The user must have
	   already done these two things already to be able to read INSTALL in
	   the first place.

	 * Update README. In particular,
	   - Remove version-specific information in header.
	   - Clarify webhost information in Credits section.

1.4     * Released 141022

	* Incorporate patches from Debian.

	* Now maintained by Window Maker Developers Team.

1.3b	* Released 980513

	* Splitted up WMPPP and WMiFS into separate programs.

	* WMiFS now uses our 'newstyle' shared dockapps code,
	  it's quite rewritten again.

	* WMiFS now reads /proc/dev/net instead of /proc/net/route.

	* Changed the RC file parsing and handling again.

	* Now ignores DUMMY interface too :)

	* Fixed the 'Zombie' bug :)

	* Better 'execvp' code :)

	* Vastly reduced X CPU usage :)


1.2p1	* Released 980502

        * Updated the docs, sorry, we forgot to update some
          of them, due to some last minute changes in the code
          the docs where incorrect on some parts (systemrc).

        * Updated the Makefile because the systemrc files
          went to the wrong location (due to above changes).

        * Updated the WMPPP rc files, again, due to some last
          minute changes in the code, WMPPP's rc files where
          no longer working properly.


1.2	* Released 980429

	* Completely revamped the WMPPP & WMiFS GUI :)

	* Added 'forceleft, forcemiddle and forceright'
	  options in WMiFS for 'real' multiuser systems,
	  when 'force*' is detected in /etc/wmifsrc the
	  user settings in ~/.wmifsrc are overridden
	  (useful for sites where users may not fiddle
	   with pppd's options :)

	* WMPPP: Ditto, added 'force' facility here too

	* WMPPP: now correctly redisplays time when killed
          	 and restarted

	* WMPPP: timer now starts to run when the actual
		 connection is made

	* WMPPP: added BAUD CONNECT value display

	* WMPPP: added 'getmodemspeed', a SUID proggie to
	         read the CONNECT value from /var/log/messages

	* WMPPP: dropped the config GUI and added an
	         .wmppprc file instead > motivation to do so:
	         this way, WMPPP is much more platform and
	         distribution independent :)

	* WMPPP: enhanced the status LED, yellow means
	         dialing, green means online, red means error

	* WMPPP: added -display commandline option

	* WMPPP: added -t commandline option, default
	         the timer will display HH:MM, -t will display
	         MM:SS and switch to HH:MM after 60 minutes

	* WMiFS: added support for all interfaces in
	         /proc/net/, now all interfaces are supported :)

	* WMiFS: added -display commandline option

	* WMiFS: added -w commandline option, this will
	         draw the graph in our new 'waveform' look :)

	* WMiFS: fixed the coredump problems that occurred
	         on some systems with or without .wmifsrc file
	         typo's, errors, etc. in the .wmifsrc file are
	         now also being ignored/rejected, the worst
	         thing that can happen now is that the scripts
	         do not execute (i.e. luser error) ;-)

	* WMiFS: when monitoring a ppp interface, bytes
	         are used to draw the graph, otherwise packets

	* WMiFS: made the RX/TX/Status LED box identical
	         to the one in WMPPP, the right LED is the status
	         LED, green means interface is working, red means
	         error (interface down, NIC broken, etc.)
