devmon is a daemon that monitors sys-fs files in order to detect plugs of usb
storage devices (ie : flash cards)

When a device is detected, devmon mounts it and start a dockapp that allows to
launch your favorite filemanager (left click) or unmount the device (right
click).

For 2.6 kernel users only!
