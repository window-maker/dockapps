CDMON is a plug & play daemon that monitors CD medias' insertion.

When a CD is detected, cdmon mounts it and displays a dockapp that allows:
- to launch your favorite filemanager (left click)
- to unmount the device and eject CD (right click).

The dockapp also shows the "model" of the CD reader/writer.
