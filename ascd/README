This archive includes the original ascd 0.13.2 archive and the latest
LibWorkMan snapshot (990620). To compile the software:

  - run ./configure (*)
  - make
  - make install
  - make install.man

(*) configure will ask you a few question about ascd options. If you want
to use the default settings, run ./default instead of ./configure.

Important note:
---------------

I changed two things in libworkman:

1) I added #under OSS_SUPPORT in plat_linux.c in order to definitly
prevent libworkman to use the mixer.

2) I added wm_cddb.h in installed files as it was missing in the
original tarball.

Upgrading from ascd <= 0.12.X
-----------------------------

Ascd 0.13 uses the last libworkman snapshot and is *not* compatible
with the previous ones. Do not forget to compile and install the
snapsnot included in this archive before trying to compile ascd 0.13.

More infos:

I strongly suggest to read the following texts:

  - in libworkman/ dir, read the README file and edit Config file.
  - in ascd/ dir, read the README file.
