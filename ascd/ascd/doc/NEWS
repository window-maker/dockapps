New features in ascd 0.13-beta:
===============================

(it is a big big big release, as I had to redesign or rewrite nearly
everything in the soft except the CD control functions. So, I'm
considering this code as beta stage one.)

* Visual Themes:

  Visual themes are now 100% configurable. A theme consist in a description
  file and various pixmaps. You can place any screen element anywhere in the
  window and the icon. Available screen elements:

  - pixmaps
  - counter
  - track number
  - message area
  - database display area
  - direct access horizontal, vertical and inverted vertical bars
  - hardware volume horizontal, vertical and inverted vertical bars
  - mixer control horizontal, vertical and inverted vertical bars

  For each element, you specify the *command* to use for the three mouse
  buttons. AScd provides commands to control the general options, the CD
  player and the mixer.

  AScd is no longer restricted to a "dockable" size. More: In -w mode, it's
  now possible to have different screen layouts for the main window and the
  icon one

* Mixer support is back (FreeBSD and Linux are the only supported platforms)
* New documentation (PostScript) about making new themes
* LibWorkman updated to 990505, with early CDDB support (but it is *not*
  yet supported by AScd)
* database support has been enhanced
* Quick Reference gif files support with an external viewer (xv by default)
* the font used in messages and database is now 8bit compatible, thanks to
  Stefan Zeiger who made an excellent 8bit new font

  - plat_openbsd.c added
* Added an option in Config to compile libworkman as a
  shared library (this works with ascd 0.8 too)

  Eject now works and there're no more device locking!

  per button, and several pixmaps are new.

  can be changed with commandline options). Note that mute
  function controls the CD Drive Volume, and is independant
  from the mixer module.
