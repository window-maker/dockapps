TODO list for WMMon.
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is a list of things we've already planned for WMMon-1.0:

	* Commandline? option for LED colors;
	* Optional LCD GUI, either compiletime or runtime;
	* Lower CPU usage (only in SysInfo mode) CPU and I/O
	  mode are very low in CPU usage now ;-);
	* Multiple CPU support;
	* GUI mode for simultanious CPU/IO/MEM&SWAP realtime 
	  loadbars (like Matt suggested ;-) );

Your feedback! If you have nice suggestions, ideas, whatever,
that aren't on this list, feel free to mail them to:

	dockapps@windowmaker.mezaway.org

If you don't let us know... how are we suppose to know? ;-)
