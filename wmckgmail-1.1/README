*******************
*** DESCRIPTION ***
*******************

wmckgmail is a very simple program used to monitor the number of unread mails 
in a gmail inbox. It uses the wget command to get the gmail atom feed and reads 
the number of new mails from this feed. It is a dockapp that is supported by X 
window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, Fluxbox and 
Enlightenment.

This dockapp is quite simple. It contains the gmail M icon and a small counter. 
When the program is unable to access gmail, the counter shows the "ERR" string 
and the M icon is greyed. When gmail is accessible and your configuration file 
contains a valid username/password combo, the counter indicate the number of 
new mails in the gmail inbox. If there is no unread mails in the gmail inbox, 
the M icon stays greyed. If there is unread mails in the gmail inbox, the M iconthen takes its real colors and the counter indicates the number of unread mails.

*** OPTIONS ***
***************

This program has no command line options.

*********************
*** CONFIGURATION ***
*********************

This program needs a configuration file to work. This file must be found as:

    $HOME/.wmckgmail/config

This configuration file contains "<key> <value>" parameters. There is some 
mandatory parameters that requires to be defined in this file in order to make 
the program work:

    uname <gmail username>
           Set the username of the gmail mailbox to monitor

    pass <gmail password>
           Set the password of the gmail mailbox to monitor

There is also optional parameters: 

    pollinterval <seconds between each new mail verification>
           Used to define the interval between each verification of new incoming mails. If you do 
           not define this parameter, it will be set to a default value of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

    browsercmd1 <command to launch when clicking on the 'big M'>
           Used to define the command to launch when clicking on the 'big M'. 
           Example configuration line: 'browsercmd1 mozilla -remote "openURL(http://www.gmail.com)"'

    browsercmd2 <command to launch when clicking on the 'big M' if 'browsercmd1' failed>
           Used to define the command to launch when clicking on the 'big M'  IF the execution
           of 'browsercmd1' failed.
           Example configuration line: 'browsercmd2 mozilla http://www.gmail.com &'

-- WARNINGS --

- It is very recommended to set the configuration file permissions to "600" or 
"400" as your mailbox password is clearly written in this file.

- When defining 'browsercmd1' or 'browsercmd2', verify if the command you launch returns immediately
to the shell or not. If the command does NOT returns to the shell, you have to put an ampersand (&)
to launch the command in background like in the 'browsercmd2' example configuration line.
