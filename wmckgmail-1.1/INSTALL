*********************
*** CONFIGURATION ***
*********************

The wmckgmail program is independent for each user. To be able to use it, you 
need to create a folder in the user home directory ($HOME/.wmckgmail).

In this folder, you need to create the configuration file ($HOME/.wmckgmail/config).

This configuration file works in "<key> <value>" pairs. There is two mandatory 
entries that needs to be defined :

  uname <gmail username>
  pass <gmail user password>

There is also an optional parameter used to define the interval (in seconds) 
between each new emails verification. If you don't define this value, a default 
of 300 seconds (5 minutes) will be used.

  pollinterval <number of seconds between each verification>

--- WARNING ---

It is strongly recommended to set the permissions on the configuration file to 
something like "600" or "400" as your gmail account password is clearly written 
into it.
