Overview of Changes in WMCPULoad 0.9.0:


New windowed mode
-----------------

If you want to run wmcpuload as *non-dockable* application, please use command
line options:

    '-w, --windowed' or '-wp, --windowed-withpanel'

These options will help you if you want to use wmcpuload with window managers
which are NOT support dockapps and also it is useful to swallow into
AfterStep's Wharf or GNOME Panel. For more information, please see README.
