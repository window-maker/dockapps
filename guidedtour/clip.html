<p>By default, The clip is represented by the icon on the top left of
the screen containing a paperclip image.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 64px; height: 64px;" alt="Clip icon" src="images/clip.png"><br>
</p>

<p>The clip's primary function is to serve as a workspace-specific
dock. In
other words, applications may be attached to the clip just as they are
to the dock, but the clip and its associated applications are specific
to each individual workspace - not available on all workspaces as they
are on the dock.</p>

<p>The clip's secondary function is to act as a "pager" - a utility for
changing from one workspace to another (paging). The arrows at the top
right and bottom left corners of the clip icon allow you to switch from
one workspace to the next workspace (top right) or previous workspace
(bottom left).
</p>

<p>The current workspace name (if any) and number are displayed on the
clip. <br>
</p>

<p>The clip also has a number of menu-driven features.
</p>

<h2>Clip Menu</h2>

<p>Right-clicking the clip displays a menu. </p>

<h2>Clip Options<br>

</h2>


The first menu item allows you to select clip options. The following
options are available:<br>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Keep on top</span> - do not
allow windows to cover the clip. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Collapsed</span> - icons
attached to the clip are hidden until you left-click the clip, which
unhides them.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Autocollapse</span> - same as
the previous option, except that mouseing over the clip unhides
application icons.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Autoraise</span> - clicking an
icon representing a
window hidden under a larger window brings that window to the front.</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Autoattract icons</span>
- selecting this option attracts the icon of any application launched
on the current workspace. Closing the application removes the icon from
the clip.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rename Workspace</h2>


This item gives you to ability to name (or rename) the current
workspace. <br>

<br>

Some users tend to group certain applications by workspace
and like to name the workspace to indicate the nature of the
applications on the clip. For example, a user might have a browser, an
IRC client, and a file transfer application clipped on a workspace, and
might name that workspace "internet" to indicate the workspace's
primary function. The user might have a seperate workspace with a
vector graphics application, an image manipulation application, and an
image viewer on the clip, and might name that workspace "graphics."<br>

<br>

<h2>Other Options</h2>


Right-clicking a clipped application's icon gives options specific to
that application. <br>

<ul>

  <li>You may make the application's icon <span style="font-style: italic;">omnipresent</span>
(clipped on all workspaces). <br>
  </li>
  <li>You may <span style="font-style: italic;">select</span> one or all clipped icons. <br>
  </li>
  <li>You may <span style="font-style: italic;">move</span>
one or all icons to a
different workspace. <br>
  </li>
  <li>You may <span style="font-style: italic;">remove</span> the icon.</li>
  <li>You may instruct Window Maker to have all icons "<span style="font-style: italic;">attracted</span>" to
the clip as soon as each application is launched, rather than placing them intially in the defined location on the display. </li>
</ul>

The remaining clip menu items are similar to those of the <a href="dock.html#conf" target="_blank">dock
application icon menu</a>.
As with the dock, clipped applications may be launched, hidden, or
killed and their settings (icon used, application launch
path/arguments, middle-click launch) may be
modified. <br>

<br>

From version 0.80.0 on, the clip can "steal" appicons. This feature has
nothing to
do with autoattracting icons. When you start an application from somewhere
other than either the clip or the dock (i.e., from the menu or a
terminal), and the application is already either docked or clipped, a
new application icon does not appear at the bottom
of your
screen. The icon that is already docked or clipped "steals" the icon
function. As a
result, the icon for the newly-launched application is the icon already on
the
clip or
the dock. <br>
