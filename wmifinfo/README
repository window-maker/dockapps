DESCRIPTION

  wmifinfo is a simple applet showing basic network info for all available
  interfaces. It shows IP address, netmask, gateway and MAC address. A bit
  like ifconfig. 

  Runs on Linux and OpenBSD (for now)

  Left-button click moves to the next interface, right-button click calls
  ifup/ifdown scripts. These can be set with the -u and -d options. The 
  '%s' variable is replaced with the interface name.

  example : 

  $ wmifinfo -i ppp0 -u "/sbin/ifup %s" -d "/sbin/ifdown %s"

  (ifup/ifdown or the wmifinfo binaries should be suid root for this
  to work)

  Led color    Meaning
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  red          interface is down
  yellow       ifup/ifdown script is busy
  dark green   interface is up, no traffic
  light green  interface is up, and sending or receiving





INSTALLING

  - If you have a NoWiresNeeded 1148 or Swallo NIC, set ENABLE_NWN_SUPPORT
    to 'y' in the makefile to enable wlan signal indication for this type of
    network adapter.

  - make

  - make install



USAGE

  usage: wmifinfo [-lh] [-i interface]
    -d <cmd>         Command to exec for iface-down
    -i <interface>   Start with given interface, if available
    -l               LCD display mode
    -h               Print this help
    -u <cmd>         Command to exec for iface-up
    -v               Show version info and exit


KNOWN BUGS

  - The link quality readout of the poldhu/swallow cards is slow and may be
    unreliable, due to the way this is implemented in the firmware and
    driver.  (Bas?)


THANKS

  - Peter Stromberg for adding OpenBSD support
  - Ben Stern for endian-correctness and old-libc support patches
  - Michael G. Henderson's wmWeather for some example dockapp code.
